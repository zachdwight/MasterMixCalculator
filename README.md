# MasterMixCalculator
This is a generic master mix calculator. The defaults are set for a PCR master mix, but components can be added or removed and component names can be changed/dragged.

Enter in the relative concentrations of stock and final components (units don’t matter), the master mix fold (e.g. 2, 5, 10), the volume of one reaction (uL) and number of reactions desired. The program returns the volume of each stock component and water, the total master mix volume, and the total component volume. If the total component volume is greater than the master mix volume, an error indicates that you must reduce the master mix fold (or increase the concentration of the stock components).
